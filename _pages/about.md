🧑‍🎓 I'm a Senior undergraduate at Northwestern University

📖 I'm currently working towards a Major in Computer Science, Minor in Business Institutions, and Design Certificate

🔬 My research interests are in Human Computer Interaction and Data Analysis


# Selected Experiences
## 🏢 Internships
I have completed two internships at General Motors. My first summer, I worked in the Manufacturing Cybersecurity Team. During my assignment, I developed a Python-based program which runs on all plant environment PCs to ensure compliance with internal cybersecurity standards. My second summer, I worked in Data Strategy & Intelligence. By using the ETL data extraction process, I was able to obtain vehicle usage data from over 300,000 production vehicles and create a series of visualizations in PowerBi. These visualizations have assisted other data teams within General Motors in understanding trends in real-world data usage.  

## 🔬 Research
I have worked under Giorgia Chinazzo, Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, to develop a web-scraping program which analyzes home listings on Zillow. Further, I used Pandas to perform data clean-up and organization by zip code for every major metropolitan area in the United States. 

In addition, I have worked under Guy Adami, Associate Professor of Oral Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, by developing a program in R which considers the correlation between certain health conditions and the presence of specific bacteria in a patient's mouth.
